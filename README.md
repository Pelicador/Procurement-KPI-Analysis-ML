# Procurement KPI Analysis Project Report

## 1. Executive Summary

### The Challenge That Brought Us Here
Our procurement organization faced mounting pressures in 2022â€“2023: rising costs, inconsistent supplier performance, and increasing quality complaints. With $49.3M in annual procurement spend across 777 purchase orders, we needed answers.

### The Investigation: What We Discovered
We reduced procurement spend from $49.3M to $45.4M (a $3.9M savings, 7.97%). But we uncovered performance disparities threatening operational stability.

### The Transformation: Machine Learning Meets Procurement
Developed predictive models with 88.7% accuracy in delivery forecasting. A shift from reactive to proactive risk management.

### The Path Forward: Strategic Recommendations
Immediate action on:
- Supplier performance management
- Quality control
- Predictive analytics integration

- **Defect Rate**: Avg. 5.78%
- **Compliance**: 82.37%
- **Binary Flags**: Delivery occurred

---

## 4. Key Stakeholder Questions

### Performance Standards
- Whatâ€™s an acceptable defect rate?
- Is 82.37% compliance good enough?

### Supplier Strategy
- Should all suppliers be held to the same standard?
- What are grounds for termination?

### Category Strategy
- Should negotiation differ by category?
- How do we balance volume vs. performance?

### Investment
- Budget for ML deployment?
- Focus: short-term savings or long-term partnerships?

---

## 5. Assumptions and Caveats

### Assumptions
- Negotiated_Price = final contract price
- Delivery_Date = actual delivery (not scheduled)
- Compliance scoring was consistent

### External Factors
- Inflation and supply chain disruption affected pricing
- High category price variability may skew results

---

## 6. Insights: What the Data Tells Us

### Cost Savings Highlights
- **Total Savings**: $3.9M (7.97%)
- **By Category**:
  - Electronics: 12.2% ($9.8M â†’ $8.6M)
  - MRO: 8.2% ($11.6M â†’ $10.7M)
  - Office Supplies: 2.9% ($10.3M â†’ $10.0M)

### Risk & Opportunity
- **High-Risk**: Electronics & Raw Materials (compliance, quality)
- **High-Spend**: MRO = $11.6M (biggest risk if supplier fails)
