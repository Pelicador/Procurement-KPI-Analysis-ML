# Procurement KPI Analysis Project Report
#### A Data-Driven Journey to Procurement Excelence

## 1. Executive Summary

### The Challenge That Brought Us Here
Our procurement organization faced mounting pressures in 2022-2023: rising costs, inconsistent supplier performance, and increasing quality complaints from internal stakeholders. With $49.3M in annual procurement spend across 777 purchase orders, we needed answers to critical questions plaguing our operations.

### The Investigation: What We Discovered
Through comprehensive analysis of our procurement data spanning 2022-2023, we uncovered a tale of two procurement worlds. While our negotiation efforts successfully reduced spending from $49.3M to $45.4M—achieving $3.9M in cost savings (7.97% average)—beneath this success story lurked concerning performance disparities that threatened our operational stability.

### The Transformation: Machine Learning Meets Procurement
Our advanced analytics initiative culminated in developing a comprehensive supplier rating system and predictive models achieving 88.7% accuracy in forecasting delivery outcomes. This breakthrough positions us to transform from reactive firefighting to proactive risk management, potentially saving an additional money annually while dramatically reducing operational disruptions.

### The Path Forward: Strategic Recommendations
Our findings demand immediate action on supplier performance management, quality control enhancement, and technology deployment. The data tells a clear story: optimize high-performers, remediate underperformers, and leverage predictive analytics to prevent future challenges.

- **Secondary Goal**: Engineer relevant features and KPIs from raw operational data to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.
- **Advanced Goal**: Develop a high-accuracy machine learning model to predict delivery occurrence and critically evaluate performance drivers.

### Stakeholders
- **Procurement Managers**: Needed supplier performance insights and contract negotiation leverage
- **Finance Team**: Required cost optimization opportunities and budget variance explanations
- **Operations**: Demanded delivery reliability improvements and quality assurance
- **Executive Leadership**: Sought strategic supplier relationship guidance and risk mitigation strategies

### Business Context
- **Volume**: 777 purchase orders representing $49.3M in original value
- **Suppliers**: 5 primary suppliers with dramatically different performance profiles
- **Categories**: Electronics, Raw Materials, MRO, Office Supplies, and Packaging
- **Scope**: Global enterprise operations requiring coordinated supplier management

| Delivery_Date      | Date        | Date of delivery (missing for pending/cancelled orders)                    |
| Item_Category      | String      | Item type (Electronics, Raw Materials, Packaging, etc.)                    |
| Order_Status       | String      | Delivered, Pending, Cancelled, or Partially Delivered                      |
| Quantity           | Integer     | Units ordered (includes large orders for bulk procurement)                |
| Unit_Price         | Float       | Original price per unit                                                    |
| Negotiated_Price   | Float       | Final price post-negotiation                                               |
| Defective_Units    | Integer     | Defects reported post-delivery (missing for unresolved cases)              |
| Compliance         | Boolean     | Adherence to procurement policies (Yes/No)                                 |


### Initial Data Investigations
- **Missing Data Patterns**:
  - **87 missing Delivery_Date values**: Indicated pending/cancelled orders requiring special handling
  - **136 missing Defective_Units records**: Suggested unresolved quality cases, treated as zero defects for initial analysis
  - **1 missing Negotiated_Price**: Single outlier requiring imputation using Unit_Price
- **Data Integrety Validation**:
  - **No negative values** in quantity, prices, or defects—confirming data quality
  - **No instances** where negotiated_price exceeded unit_price—validating negotiation effectiveness
  - **Zero duplicate rows**—ensuring analytical accuracy

### Feature Engineering: Creating Business Intelligence

## 4. Key Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

### Performance Standards Definition
- What’s an acceptable defect rate by category?
- What compliance rate is considered satisfactory?
- Are there industry benchmarks we should target for average delivery times?

### Supplier Relationship Strategy
- Should all suppliers be weighted equally, or employ different performance standards?
- What constitutes grounds for supplier termination versus performance improvement plans?

### Category Management Approach
- Should negotiation differ by category and how?
- How do we balance volume vs. performance standards across categories?

### Investment
- Should we prioritize short-term cost savings or long-term supplier relationship improvements?
- What budget is available for process improvement? Potential to implement ML model?

---

## 5. Assumptions and Caveats

### Analytical Framework Assumptions
- **Pricing Methodology**: We assumed Negotiated_Price reflects final contract terms rather than initial quotations. 
- **Delivery Performance Interpretation**: Delivery_Date represents actual final delivery rather than scheduled delivery
- **Compliance Scoring Consistency**: We assumed compliance scoring methodology remained consistent across all 777 records and suppliers.

### External Factors Beyond Our Model
- **Market Condition Impact**: Our analysis period (2022-2023) coincided with significant inflation and supply chain disruptions.
- **Category-Specific Limitations**: The high standard deviation in item category pricing may limit the utility of our inflation modeling. Additional data and stakeholder input on specific item price histories would enhance accuracy.
