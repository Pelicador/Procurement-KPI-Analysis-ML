## 4. Key Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

### Performance Standards Definition
- What’s an acceptable defect rate by category?
- What compliance rate is considered satisfactory?
- Are there industry benchmarks we should target for average delivery times?

### Supplier Relationship Strategy
- Should all suppliers be weighted equally, or employ different performance standards?
- What constitutes grounds for supplier termination versus performance improvement plans?

### Category Management Approach
- Should negotiation differ by category and how?
- How do we balance volume vs. performance standards across categories?

### Investment Priorities
- Should we prioritize short-term cost savings or long-term supplier relationship improvements?
- What budget is available for process improvement? Potential to implement ML model?

---

## 5. Assumptions and Caveats

### Analytical Framework Assumptions
- **Pricing Methodology**: We assumed Negotiated_Price reflects final contract terms rather than initial quotations. 
- **Delivery Performance Interpretation**: Delivery_Date represents actual final delivery rather than scheduled delivery
- **Compliance Scoring Consistency**: We assumed compliance scoring methodology remained consistent across all 777 records and suppliers.

### External Factors Beyond Our Model
- **Market Condition Impact**: Our analysis period (2022-2023) coincided with significant inflation and supply chain disruptions.
- **Category-Specific Limitations**: The high standard deviation in item category pricing may limit the utility of our inflation modeling. Additional data and stakeholder input on specific item price histories would enhance accuracy.

## 6. Procurement Insights: What the Data Tells Us

### Key Performance Indicators
Our procurement team demonstrated remarkable negotiation skills, reducing total spend from $49.3M to $45.4M. This $3.9M achievement (7.97% average savings) tells a story of skilled procurement professionals maximizing organizational value. However, with an average compliance rate of 82.37%, defective rate of 5.78% and delivery time of 10.80 days, the other KPIs indicate a need to improve operational efficiency.

![Total Procurement Spend](/docs/Total_Procurement.png)
![Other KPI](/docs/Other_KPI_Cards.png)

Category-specific success patterns shows that negotiated procurement efforts led to savings across all categories. The most significant reductions occurred in MRO (from $11.0M to $10.1M) and Office Supplies (from $10.9M to $10.0M), highlighting effective cost control in high-spend areas.

![Procurement Category](/docs/Procurement_Spend_Category.png)

Order fulfillment performance are similar across all five suppliers. Alpha_Inc has the highest delivery rate at 75.89%, while most suppliers (Delta_Logistics, Epsilon_Group, Beta_Supplies, and Gamma_Co) have delivered around 70-72% of their orders. Cancellation rates are relatively low across all suppliers (under 10%), with pending orders ranging from about 10-12% for most suppliers.

![Order Status](/docs/Order_Status_Supplier.png)

Defective rate trending upward indicating potential capacity or reliability issues requiring investigation. The defective rate started around 4% in early 2022, fluctuated between 4-7% throughout most of the period, but then sharply increased to nearly 9% by January 2024, indicating a concerning deterioration in quality control.

![Defective Rate Time](/docs/Defective_Rate_Time.png)


### Supplier Performance Analysis
Suppliers were assessed across five key performance metrics to determine their overall effectiveness and reliability. The evaluation criteria included compliance rate (adherence to contract terms), average defective percentage (quality control), average savings percentage (cost efficiency), average lead time (delivery speed), and relative price volatility percentage (pricing stability).

![Supplier Performance](/docs/Supplier_Performance.png)

1. **Excellence Exemplified - Epsilon_Group:** This supplier represents procurement partnership at its finest: 98.19% compliance, 2.61% defective rate, 8.04% savings, and low relative price volatility. Their performance demonstrates what's achievable with proper supplier development.
2. **Reliability Proven - Alpha_Inc:** With 93.62% compliance and industry-leading 1.89% defective rate, Alpha_Inc shows consistent excellence across all metrics while delivering 8.21% cost savings.
3. **Steady Performance - Gamma_Co:** Representing the middle tier of our supplier portfolio, Gamma_Co delivers 86.01% compliance with a moderate 4.50% defective rate. While not achieving the excellence of our top performers, this supplier maintains acceptable 7.98% cost savings and reasonable 10.19-day lead time.
4. **Quality Concerns - Beta_Supplies:** With 8.27% defective rate and 11.27-day lead times, Beta_Supplies requires immediate performance improvement planning despite handling 180,516 units annually.
5. **The Underperformance Crisis - Delta_Logistics:** Despite handling our highest volume (190,552 units), Delta_Logistics delivers our worst performance: 60.82% compliance, 10.87% defective rate, and lowest average savings percentage. This supplier represents our greatest operational risk and strategic challenge.

### Supplier Performance Ratings
The five performance metrics were converted into standardized 1-5 ratings for each supplier across six categories: Compliance (based on compliance rate), Quality (based on defective percentage), Price Competitiveness (based on savings percentage), Delivery (based on lead time), and Price Volatility Control (based on price volatility percentage). These individual ratings were then averaged to create an overall Average Score, providing a comprehensive supplier performance ranking from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).

![Supplier Ratings](/docs/Supplier_Ratings.png)

1. **Top Rated Suppliers** (scoring 4 and above): recognized as top performers and receive preferential benefits such as favorable payment terms, exclusive business opportunities, or co-marketing support.
2. **Middle Rated Suppliers** (between 3 and 4): subject to enhanced incoming inspection protocols and regular performance reviews to drive improvement.
3. **Low Rated Suppliers** (below 3): receive a 30-60 day performance improvement ultimatum with specific targets that must be met to continue the partnership.

## 7. Machine Learning: Predicting Delivery Success

### The Predictive Analytics Challenge
Traditional procurement operates reactively—addressing delivery failures, quality issues, and compliance gaps after they occur. Our machine learning initiative aimed to transform this paradigm by predicting delivery outcomes before or when purchase orders are placed.

### Model Development Journey
**The Prediction Goal:** Determine whether orders will be successfully delivered based on supplier characteristics, item categories, quantities, pricing, and compliance history.

**Feature Selection Strategy:** We identified eight critical predictive features: supplier identity, item_category, quantity, unit_price, negotiated_price, order_year, order_month, and compliance status. These features represent the information available at order placement, making predictions actionable.

**Algorithm Performance Battle:** We deployed eight different machine learning algorithms in head-to-head competition:

| Algorithm             | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Gradient Boosting     | 88.70%   ✅ Best |
| Random Forest         | 86.67%   |
| AdaBoost              | 81.16%   |
| SVM                   | 79.42%   |
| Decision Tree         | 78.55%   |
| KNN                   | 76.52%   |
| Logistic Regression   | 70.14%   |
| Naive Bayes           | 67.54%   |

**The Winner - Gradient Boosting:** 88.70% Accuracy This ensemble method emerged as our champion, combining multiple weak learners to achieve superior prediction accuracy. Its ability to handle complex supplier-category interactions made it ideal for our procurement complexity.

### Predictive Model Business Impact
**Operational Transformation Potential:** With 88.70% accuracy, our Gradient Boosting model can identify high-risk purchase orders before approval, enabling proactive intervention rather than reactive damage control.

**Risk Mitigation Capability:** The model's ability to predict delivery failure allows procurement managers to:
- Require additional supplier commitments for high-risk orders
- Implement enhanced monitoring for predicted problem orders
- Adjust delivery expectations for internal customers
- Develop contingency sourcing for critical high-risk purchases
